# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
    The CAM is completely inferred from behavioral verilog by yosys. For each register in `data`, a comparator checks whether its value equals that of `content`; If so, it updates the corresponding line in `found_addr` to equal `HIGH`, otherwise, it equals `LOW`. Writing to the CAM is accomplished by raising the active-HIGH `we`, in which case the memory will automatically cycle through available registers. On running out of registers, the oldest data will be replaced with the new value.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Please consult the testbench (`src/test.py`, written in cocotb) for comprehensive machine-readable test vectors.
